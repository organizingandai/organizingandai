          What could the organizational culture that exist in the Aviation Industry teach us about the possibilities for shared accountability and shared responsibility in the field of AI?
        </p><p>
          We looked at how automation was introduced in the field of Aviation, specifically how agency and responsibility is split between the different actors involved.
          For example, the pilot of an aircraft, the operators at the Air Traffic Control station on the ground, as well as the manufacturer of the aircraft engine, all bare the responsibility.
          In 1967, a National Transportation Safety Board was established in the US where the "go-team" model was introduced.
        </p>
        <p> The "go-team" model employs a rotating task-force of 8-12 experts trained in technical, policy, social-science, media, forensic, and community management matters.
          The multi-faceted quantitative and qualitative data that this task-force generates feeds back to industry stakeholders
          to improve airline safety and to inform government stakeholders so they can improve the relevant infrastructure,
          such as Air Traffic Control systems.
        </p>
        <p> The NTSB was involved in the investigation of a recent fatal self-driving vehicle accident,
          producing an <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20191119c.aspx">over 400 page report including findings and recommendations</a>.

        <p>
        Ethnography, and the many disciplines that count ethnography as a core method, provide crucial perspectives on the topics within fair-ML work, by illuminating the context and interconnected relationships surrounding algorithmic systems. As explored by scholar Nick Seaver in his work on critical algorithmic studies, ethnography could enable practitioners to "enact algorithms not as inaccessible black boxes, but as heterogeneous and diffuse sociotechnical systems, with entanglements beyond the boundaries of proprietary software" [1]. The "scavenging ethnographer", he describes, has developed an understanding of algorithms not as singular technological objects but rather as "culture" because they are composed of collective human practices. Considering how people enact algorithms through their actions requires the development of reflexive practices recognizing that "any model of social behavior is inseparable from the social context and research methods from which it was produced" [2].

        Drawing from prior work by Michael Veale et al., investigating the challenges of practitioners
        operating within high-stakes public sector institutions, we see that many of them are related to
        organizational structure [1]. Situating the development of AI systems within different organizational cultures gives us
        new insights on debated FAT* issues of power imbalance, discrimination, and many others. As scholar
        Anna Hoffman explores in her work, "designers and engineers are limited in their ability to address
        broad social and systemic problems" [2] and overcoming these limits requires broader socio-technical understanding. Recent work by Andrew Selbst et al.
        developed a framework for identifying and mitigating the failure modes or "traps" which arise from failing to consider
        the interrelationship between social context and technology [3]. We build on their work and provide new perspectives
        on some of the concrete characteristics of the Framing Trap, the Portability Trap, and the Solutionism Trap. Our work remains focused
        on the complex human and algorithmic interactions [4] within the larger organizational and social context where these traps are enacted.

        <p> The work within the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency of AI community relates to the field of AI Safety and Verification.
          In the fields of Computer Science and Machine Learning the process of verification has been defined by ML
          researchers as
          "producing a compelling argument that the system will not misbehave under a broad range of circumstances" [1].
          Traditionally, in Machine Learning research, there's a difference between testing and verification.
          Testing refers to evaluating the system in concrete conditions and making sure that it behaves as expected.
          Testing has evolved to be a major part of software development ever since its early developments in the
          1950s.
